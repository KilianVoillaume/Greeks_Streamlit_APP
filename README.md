# Options Greeks Visualizer

An interactive Streamlit app to explore how option Greeks behave under the Black-Scholes model.

---

## Overview

This project is a hands-on visualisation tool for understanding option sensitivities — also known as the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) — in the context of the Black-Scholes-Merton framework. Built with Streamlit and Matplotlib, it enables users to adjust key inputs such as stock price, strike, volatility, interest rate, dividend yield, and time to maturity, and immediately observe the resulting changes in price and sensitivities.

This tool is intended for students, quants, risk managers, and anyone interested in how theoretical models map to intuitive market behaviours. The emphasis is on clarity, interaction, and insight.
